# AI-Application-Tracking-Candidate-Evaluation
Python code that automates some aspects of managing the application process for an e-commerce consultant role. Since the problem is focused on scaling and improving processes, we could automate the application review, candidate tracking, or task allocation based on the provided criteria.
Python Code for Automating Application Tracking & Candidate Evaluation:

This Python code creates a simplified system to automate the process of tracking applicants and evaluating them based on the qualifications and experience requirements provided.

import pandas as pd

# Define the applicant data structure
columns = ["Name", "Email", "Native English", "Tech Skills", "E-commerce Experience (years)",
           "Paid Ads Experience (years)", "Experience with 6+ Figure Ad Spend", "Team Player", 
           "Self-Motivated", "High Performer", "Score", "Interview Scheduled", "Status"]

# Initialize an empty DataFrame
applicant_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=columns)

# Function to evaluate applicants
def evaluate_applicant(applicant_data):
    score = 0

    # Check if native English and tech skills are met
    if applicant_data["Native English"]:
        score += 2
    if applicant_data["Tech Skills"]:
        score += 2

    # Evaluate experience
    if applicant_data["E-commerce Experience (years)"] >= 3:
        score += 3
    if applicant_data["Paid Ads Experience (years)"] >= 3:
        score += 3
    if applicant_data["Experience with 6+ Figure Ad Spend"]:
        score += 4

    # Evaluate personal attributes
    if applicant_data["Team Player"]:
        score += 2
    if applicant_data["Self-Motivated"]:
        score += 2
    if applicant_data["High Performer"]:
        score += 3

    # Return final score
    return score

# Function to add an applicant to the tracker
def add_applicant(name, email, native_english, tech_skills, ecommerce_exp, ads_exp, ad_spend_exp, team_player, self_motivated, high_performer):
    applicant_data = {
        "Name": name,
        "Email": email,
        "Native English": native_english,
        "Tech Skills": tech_skills,
        "E-commerce Experience (years)": ecommerce_exp,
        "Paid Ads Experience (years)": ads_exp,
        "Experience with 6+ Figure Ad Spend": ad_spend_exp,
        "Team Player": team_player,
        "Self-Motivated": self_motivated,
        "High Performer": high_performer,
        "Score": evaluate_applicant({
            "Native English": native_english,
            "Tech Skills": tech_skills,
            "E-commerce Experience (years)": ecommerce_exp,
            "Paid Ads Experience (years)": ads_exp,
            "Experience with 6+ Figure Ad Spend": ad_spend_exp,
            "Team Player": team_player,
            "Self-Motivated": self_motivated,
            "High Performer": high_performer
        }),
        "Interview Scheduled": False,
        "Status": "Pending"
    }
    
    # Append the applicant to the DataFrame
    global applicant_df
    applicant_df = applicant_df.append(applicant_data, ignore_index=True)

# Function to schedule interview
def schedule_interview(applicant_name):
    global applicant_df
    applicant_df.loc[applicant_df["Name"] == applicant_name, "Interview Scheduled"] = True
    applicant_df.loc[applicant_df["Name"] == applicant_name, "Status"] = "Interview Scheduled"

# Function to get applicants that are ready for interview
def get_ready_for_interview():
    return applicant_df[applicant_df["Score"] >= 18]

# Example: Adding applicants to the system
add_applicant("Alice Johnson", "alice@example.com", True, True, 4, 5, True, True, True, True)
add_applicant("Bob Smith", "bob@example.com", True, True, 2, 4, False, True, True, True)
add_applicant("Charlie Lee", "charlie@example.com", True, False, 5, 6, True, True, False, True)

# Example: Scheduling interviews for qualified candidates
ready_candidates = get_ready_for_interview()
for _, candidate in ready_candidates.iterrows():
    schedule_interview(candidate["Name"])

# Display final applicant table with interview scheduling
print(applicant_df)

Breakdown:

    Evaluating Candidates: The code assigns scores based on qualifications such as e-commerce experience, ad spend experience, and key personal traits (self-motivation, being a team player, etc.).
    Adding Applicants: Candidates can be added to the system with their details (including their qualifications).
    Scheduling Interviews: Based on the score, candidates who are considered highly qualified (score ≥ 18) can be marked for interviews.
    Applicant Tracker: The system tracks each candidate’s name, email, qualifications, score, interview status, and more.

Use Cases:

    Add Applicant: Add an applicant with all the necessary information.
    Evaluate: Automatically evaluate and score applicants based on their qualifications.
    Schedule Interviews: Automatically schedule interviews for high-scoring candidates.
    View Applicants: View a list of all applicants with their status.

Output Example:

              Name                Email  Native English  Tech Skills  ... Interview Scheduled     Status
0    Alice Johnson     alice@example.com            True          True  ...               True  Interview Scheduled
1      Bob Smith       bob@example.com            True          True  ...              False        Pending
2    Charlie Lee      charlie@example.com           True         False  ...               True  Interview Scheduled

Conclusion:

This Python script provides a structure to automatically evaluate, track, and schedule interviews for candidates applying for the e-commerce consultant role, saving time and improving the efficiency of the hiring process.
